# Labware Instructions
This document contains the labware  previously used to implement OT2 SARS CoV2 detection workflow. Labware needs to be defined carefully when working with OpenTrons OT-2 liquid handling robot and changes to labware requires the user to update the protocol scripts and the labwares used during the execution of OT2 SARS CoV2 runs. Here is a general [OpenTrons’ Guideline](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3137426-what-labware-can-i-use-with-the-ot-2) for utilizing labware for users new to OT2, and additional details regarding labware can be found on [OpenTrons Labware Library](https://labware.opentrons.com/).
